# Street-Typography

An app to save/search/geolocate images of typography on the street whether painted lettering, neon signage, murals or graffiti. Add your own images and explore those of others. Built with React, Node, Express, Mongodb. Implements styled components, Oauth with Passport for login, Google Maps API for geolocation and Enzyme/Jest for testing.

WIP. Next: tags to categorize and find images.
